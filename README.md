# ZABX Blockchain, Coin and Exchange

# ZABX WhitePaper
# 1) What is a Coin?
Coin is an ERC20 token that aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for peer-to-peer transactions. The Coin smart contract is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, which ensures that all transactions are fast, cheap, and secure.
# 2)	Introduction
ZABx Token is a decentralized, ERC20 compliant cryptocurrency that aims to provide fast and secure transactions with low fees. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes layer 2 scaling solutions to enable high transaction volumes without sacrificing security or decentralization. It is a reliable and secure platform for peer-to-peer transactions that provides a range of useful features for both users and contract owners. Which makes it an ideal choice for a wide range of financial applications, including peer-to-peer payments, trading, and more.
# 3)	ZABx Token
The ZABx Network's native digital token, ZABx Token, is a crucial element of the ecosystem on the ZABx Network. It is intended to be used as the primary token on the network and will be issued as ERC-20 standard compliant digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
ZABx Token serves as a utility token and is the unit of payment and settlement for those interacting within the ZABx Network ecosystem. It does not represent any ownership, participation, rights, or interests in the governing body, the issuer, its affiliates, or any other company or enterprise. Additionally, ZABx Token does not entitle holders to any promises of fees, dividends, profits, or investment returns and is not intended to be considered a security in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. Possessing ZABx Token does not grant any express or implied rights, except for those possibly afforded by the ZABx Network and any third parties using such tokens.
ZABx Tokens are intended to provide economic incentives for participants to contribute to and maintain the ZABx Network ecosystem. Computational resources are needed for tasks on the ZABx Network such as validating blocks and publishing proofs, and those who provide these resources to the network (i.e. "mining" on the ZABx Network) will be rewarded with ZABx tokens. ZABx Token serves as the unit of exchange to pay for the cost of these consumed resources. ZABx Token is an essential part of the ZABx Network because without it, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to contribute to the ecosystem. Only users who actively contribute to network maintenance will receive token incentives. Users of the ZABx Network and/or holders of ZABx Token who do not actively participate will not receive any rewards.
To participate in the consensus process on the ZABx Network, users must stake ZABx Token as a sign of their commitment to the process. ZABx Token is also used as a deterrent for punishing stakers for various offenses (e.g. invalid blocks, illegally verifying blocks, or invalid transaction execution) by requiring them to stake a certain amount of ZABx Token before being allowed to participate in the ecosystem. If a staker commits an offense, their ZABx Token will be deducted.

It is important to note that ZABx Token:
1)	is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash or any payment obligation by the governing body, the issuer, or any affiliates;
2)	does not give token holders any rights with respect to the governing body, the issuer (or any affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including the right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership, voting rights, or any other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights;
3)	is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or any other contract for the purpose of securing a profit or avoiding a loss;
4)	is not intended to represent money, securities, commodities, bonds, debt instruments, or any other type of financial instrument or investment;
5)	is not a loan to the governing body, the issuer, or any affiliates and does not represent any debt owed by the governing body, the issuer, or any affiliates;
6)	does not represent any ownership or control over the governing body, the issuer, or any affiliates.

# 4)	Why do we need ZABx?
•	The current blockchain ecosystem is not prepared to scale to meet the demands of mass adoption for decentralized apps (DApps) and has poor user experience
•	Transactions on most Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchain protocols are slow and have limited throughput due to block size limits and block confirmation times
•	Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchains with high throughput often compromise on decentralization
•	The ZABx Network uses a high throughput blockchain with consensus provided by selected Block Producers and decentralized PoS checkpoints to achieve fast block confirmation times and high level of decentralization
•	The ZABx Network can theoretically achieve high transaction throughput by using multiple side chains
•	Public blockchains' increasing size and validation requirements lead to fewer full nodes and risk to decentralization
•	The ZABx Network's primary layer stores only the block headers and validates them using PoS checkpoints, reducing storage requirements and enabling more nodes to join the network
•	High transaction fees on public blockchains discourage widespread usage and adoption
•	The ZABx Network uses a network of stakers (are who individuals or organizations that hold a certain amount of a particular cryptocurrency in order to help secure the network by validating transactions on the blockchain) to ensure that the system remains decentralized, and charges lower transaction fees compared to mainchain transactions
•	Poor user experience on current DApps discourages widespread adoption
•	The ZABx Network aims to improve user experience through faster transaction speeds, lower transaction fees, and easy-to-use developer tools and libraries.

# 5)	Use Cases
The ZABx Network is designed to be a scalable and user-friendly ecosystem for decentralized applications. It will promote the use of various base chain DApps and award grants and funding to app developers to build various use cases on top of the ZABx Network, including:
•	Payment systems, including support for Ether, ERC20 tokens, and cross-chain atomic swaps
•	Decentralized exchanges and marketplaces for faster and cheaper trades
•	An open identity system for seamless transaction signing without the need for private keys
•	Games using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the ability to save game state on the sidechain
•	Infrastructure such as user-friendly wallets, payment SDKs, and open-source tools
•	Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
•	Supply chain management and traceability
•	The ZABx Network will also provide various services to help developers build and launch their applications, including developer support, consulting, and marketing services.

# 6)	Features of ZABx Token
ZABx Token is using all the existing features of ERC-20 provided by OpenZepplin. One of the key features of ZABx Token is its support for blacklists and whitelists. The contract owner can use the ‘addtoBlackList’ function to add an address to the blacklist, which prevents the owner of that address from making any transactions with ZABx Token. The ‘removeFromBlacklist’ function allows the contract owner to remove an address from the blacklist, restoring its ability to make transactions with ZABx Token. The ‘receive’ callback function is used to receive ethers in the smart contract. ZABx Token also includes a ‘withdrawEthers’ function, which allows the contract owner to withdraw any Ether that has been sent to the contract. This can be useful for contract owners who want to access their Ether holdings without interacting with the ZABx Token contract directly. In addition, ZABx Token includes a ‘SafeMath’ library, which provides safe math operations to prevent overflow and underflow errors. This ensures that all ZABx Token transactions are accurately calculated and processed.

# 7)	Risks of ZABx Token
Purchasing, holding, and using ZABx Tokens carries numerous risks. Regulatory status of ZABx Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions, and regulatory actions could negatively impact ZABx Tokens and the ZABx Network
1.	ZABx Network is still under development and its design, technical details, and parameters may be constantly updated and changed
2.	Industry is increasingly competitive and alternative networks with similar code and protocol may emerge and negatively impact ZABx Tokens and the ZABx Network
3.	Development of the ZABx Network may not be executed as planned due to various reasons, including declining asset prices and technical difficulties
4.	ZABx Tokens and the ZABx Network may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or malicious groups, and third parties or members of the ZABx team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the infrastructure
5.	ZABx Tokens and the ZABx Network may not be used or accepted as widely as expected, leading to limited demand and potential loss in value
6.	ZABx Tokens may not be easily transferable and could be lost or stolen due to various reasons, including loss of private keys
7.	Changes in consumer behavior and public opinion regarding distributed ledger technology and virtual currencies could negatively impact ZABx Tokens and the ZABx Network

# 8)	Features in Future Development
The ZABx Development team expects to: 
1.	Develop a Public Decentralized Layer 2 Blockchain for our token
2.	Develop a Crypto Exchange and make ZABx an exchange token
3.	To make a develop an app for all platforms.
